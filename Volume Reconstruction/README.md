IMPORTANT

My submission includes two python files and a report. The python file named cs423_project.py is the original homework implementation. cs423_project_with_matrices.py is for the implementation with matrices which is for the bonus part. In the description it says in the homework description that I should not use nested for loops. My implementation does contain nested for loops, however, it just iterate through fishes so that all fishes can be displayed in one run. Note that the one with the matrices take a lot more time than the original run. Please keep in mind that it might take a few minutes depending on your hardware. 

In both files, the images of the fish are taken from a path. I have used the relative path for convinience which means that if the python file is located inside the directory where the fish1, fish2 and fish3 directories are located, the code will run successfully. If you have the fish images in another place, please modify the paths accordingly. Note that the format of the path might also differ depending on your operating system. Please modify accordingly.

Make sure numpy, opencv and mathplotlib are downloaded and they are up to date.

When you run the program, it will show the found fish in a 3d grid. I highly suggest that you run the program using VsCode since it has good support for 3d plots. I had problems rotating the 3d plot in other IDEs. The first, second and third plots you will see corresponds to fish1, fish2 and fish3 respectively. After all plots are shown, the volumes of each fish will be outputed to the console.
